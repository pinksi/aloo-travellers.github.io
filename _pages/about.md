Hi, we are Aloo Travellers. Welcome to our diary!

This travel bug has been ingrained within us since our college days. During that time, we used to do treks on a limited budget as we were not financially independent. But, after graduating in 2017 and starting our career as software engineers, managing time in this corporate world has been a blocker for travel. Still, we take out time to travel, sometimes by taking long weekends or sometimes adjusting our travel itinerary, as it has been the only way to rejuvenate ourselves and to make us HAPPY.

Yes, our happiness lies in travel. We mostly prefer trekking around beautiful parts of Nepal, immersing in nature. This blog is all about our travel stories, the experiences and lessons learnt in our travel, the itinerary we have opted for, and all the travel information we have gained in these years. We hope our stories will inspire those who are reading this to travel and experience the feel that travelling gives us.

Happy Travelling.
