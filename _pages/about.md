Hi, we are Aloo Travellers. Welcome to our diary! 

This is the platform place where we will share our travel stories, experiences and lessons learnt during our travel, itineraries we have opted for, and our travel accomplishments (We still have a long bucket list). The motive behind creating this is to document our experiences, and to inspire people to travel more and experience the euphoria.

This travel bug has been ingrained within us since our college days. Those days, we used to trek on a limited budget as we were not financially independent. But, after graduating in 2017 and starting our career as software engineers, managing time in this corporate world has been a major blocker for travel. Still, we managed to travel, occasionally  by taking long weekends or by compromising  our travel itinerary, as it has been the only way to rejuvenate ourselves and to make us HAPPY.

Yes, our happiness lies in travel. We frequently trek around beautiful parts of Nepal, in between majestic mountains, inside dense forests, rolling in snow, drenching in rain and simply, immersing within nature.


In these years, the major treks we have done are: 

1. Ghorepani - Poonhill Trek [2015]
2. Annapurna Base Camp [2016]
3. Gosainkunda [2017]
4. Annapurna Circuit Trek [2018]
5. [Mardi Himal Trek](https://aloo-travellers.netlify.app/2020/10/12/mardi-itinerary/) [2019]


Anyone planning for any of these treks and need any suggestions, you can email us at: alootravellers@gmail.com or DM us at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aloo_travellers/).

Happy Travelling.
