Hi, we are Aloo Travellers. Welcome to our diary!

This travel bug has been affecting us since our college days, and we have done treks in a very limited budgets in those days. After graduating from college in 2017 and starting our career in software engineers, managing time in this corporate world has become a major hindrance to travel. Still, we take out time to travel, sometimes by taking long weekends or sometimes adjusting our travel itinerary, as it has been the only way to rejuvinate ourselves and to make us HAPPY. 

Yes, our happiness lies in travel. We mostly prefer trekking around beautiful parts of Nepal, immersing in nature. This blog is all about our travel stories, the experiences and lessons learnt in our travel, the itinerary we have opted for, and all the travel information we have gained in these years. We hope our stories will inspire those who are reading this to travel and experience the feel that travelling gives us.

Happy Travelling.
