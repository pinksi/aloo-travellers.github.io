Hi, we are Aloo Travellers. Welcome to our diary! 

This is the common place where, we will share our travel stories, the experiences and lessons learnt in our travel, the itinerary we have opted for, and all the travel information we have gained in these years. The simple motive of creating this is to document our experiences, with the hope that our stories will inspire people to travel and experience the euphoria.

This travel bug has been ingrained within us since our college days. During that time, we used to do treks on a limited budget as we were not financially independent. But, after graduating in 2017 and starting our career as software engineers, managing time in this corporate world has been a major blocker for travel. Still, we take out time to travel, sometimes by taking long weekends or sometimes adjusting our travel itinerary, as it has been the only way to rejuvenate ourselves and to make us HAPPY.

Yes, our happiness lies in travel. We mostly prefer trekking around beautiful parts of Nepal, in between majestic mountains, inside dense forests, rolling in snow, drenching in rain and simply, immersing within nature. 

In these years, the major treks we have done are: 

    1. Ghorepani - Poonhill Trek
    2. Annapurna Base Camp
    3. Gosainkunda
    4. Annapurna Circuit Trek
    5. Mardi Himal Trek

Anyone planning for any of these treks and need any suggestions, you can email us at: alootravellers@gmail.com or DM us at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aloo_travellers/).

Happy Travelling.
