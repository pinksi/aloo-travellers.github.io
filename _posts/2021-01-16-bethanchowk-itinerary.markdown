<i> After watching the video from Ghumante’s youtube channel, Bethanchowk has been on our bucket list for the past 2 years. The major attraction for us was camping at the top of 3000m hill. We always wanted to experience camping outdoors and the recent popularity of this place became a major driving force for us to go for this trip in November 2020.</i>

<i>When we were planning for this trip, we had a lot of information accumulated from different people and travel videos. We had a little difficulty in separating out correct information from these piles of information. In this blog post, we are sharing with you, all the details you need to know while planning for this trip so that you do not need to go through the turmoil that we had to. This year, even though it was November, the weather condition of Kathmandu valley was comparatively colder. So, all the essentials will be mentioned keeping in mind this weather condition.</i>

## Where is Bethanchowk?

*Narayanthan, Bethanchowk*

Bethanchowk Hill is situated at the height of 3000m in Dhunkharka, Kavre. It is the highest hill of the Mahabharat range and also called King of Hills. From the top, you can get stunning 360-degree views of the mountains like Ganesh Himal, Langtang Range, Manasulu Himal, and surrounding forested hills and valleys. This sunrise and sunset is the cherry on the cake. This trail is the least crowded and easiest trek for beginners. This place, also called Narayanthan is equally popular among locals for the Narayan Temple. 

## How to reach Bethanchowk?

*View from the top*

There are two option to reach bethanchowk:
1. **Public vehicle:** You have to take a bus and reach panauti bus park. From there, take a bus to Dhunkharka. There are limited buses leaving for Dhunkharka, so it is recommended to start the trip early. After you reach Dhunkharka, you have to hike for about 3- 4 hours to reach the top of bethanchowk.

2. **Private vehicle:** If you have your private vehicle (bike or four-wheelers), you can take them up to a certain place above from Dhunkharka bus park. There is ample space to park your vehicle but it is not a well-maintained parking space, and you have to left your vehicle at your own risk. From this place, it is about a 1 hr 30 min hike to reach bethanchowk.

## How can you plan this trip?

If you want to have a proper camping experience, then you can opt for **1 Night, 2 Days** trip to Bethanchowk. Otherwise, **a day trip** is possible as well.

### **1 Night 2 Days Trip**

#### **Budget:** 1500-2000 per person
 
You need to start your day early in the morning and try to reach bethanchowk by 3 pm. If you have a private vehicle, then you can start your trip from Kathmandu by 9-10 am. You can find few hotels and lodges on your way upto few kms away from Dhunkharka bus park where you can stop for lunch. Then, you can continue your trip and reach bethanchowk by 3-4 pm. You can watch both sunrise and sunset, if you plan for camping. From our personal experience, this is the best option if you want to witness everything bethanchowk offers.

In order to spend night, you must carry sleeping bags. If possible you can carry tents as well. There is only one concrete shed and few temporary tin sheds. If the place is not crowded then you can spend the night inside the shed. But recently, this place has been quite trendy among young people, so it is likely to be crowded during the weekends. Even if you stay inside the concrete shed, a sleeping bag is must, as the weather can get very cold at night.

### **A Day Trip** 

#### **Budget:** 500-1000 per person

You can complete this trip within a day as well. If you have your own vehicle, you can start this trip by 6-7 in the morning and reach here by 11-12. For breakfast or lunch, you can go to any homestay or hotels around Dhunkharka. It is recommended to carry a few snacks like energy bars, chocolates, and lots of water for the hike. You can spend some time absorbing fresh air and the beauty around, clicking a few photos, and return back. But, doing this you will miss both sunset and sunrise from this place, which are magnificent. 

To complete this trip using public vehicle might not be possible or could be in rush, as there are only limited number of buses going to Dhunkharka.

## Our Experience:

![Morning Tea]({{site.baseurl}}/images/bethanchowk/tea_morning.jpg)
*Morning Tea*

We went for 1 night and 2 days trip carrying tents and sleeping bags. We started our trip at 11 am from Bhaktapur. Since it was Saturday and we went on the bike, there was no traffic on the road. We reached Panauti at around 12 pm and bought a few essentials and set off for Dhunkharka. The road condition was quite good even though it was a graveled road. Driving it through the dense forest, in a bumpy and dusty road, with peek-a-boo of sunlight here and there, overall the road experience was okayish. But the view on the way kept getting better. We stopped at few places and viewed the entire mountain range and the valley around. 

At around 2 pm, we reached the place where we have to park our bikes. We left our bikes and started the hike. On the way, we stopped to have some snickers and juices and again continued walking. Finally, at around 4 pm, we reached the top of bethanchowk. We set up our tent and then hiked up to the top to have our packed lunch watching the sunset. After staying there for a few hours and clicking lots of photos, we finally return back to our tents and started the campfire and barbeque, playing silu music in the background. At around midnight, we went to sleep.

The next morning, we woke up early to view the sunrise and saw a lot of people waiting at the top for the sunrise. At around 6:30, finally, the sky turned yellow and we witnessed the most beautiful sunrise. We clicked few pictures and came down to our tents to cook maggie and tea. With a lot of struggle, we were finally able to lit the fire. We literally had to struggle a lot to make breakfast next morning. (That’s why we recommend carrying a gas stove if you are planning for camping). 

After having the satisfying maggie and tea, prepared with a lot of hard work, we stayed there for some time enjoying the beauty of nature, and at 10 am, started our hike downwards. We reached Banepa Bazar at 2 pm and had a hearty lunch at a Thakali restaurant, and returned home with a full belly and a happy heart.
