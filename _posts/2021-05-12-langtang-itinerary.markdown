<i>Believing that the hardest climb will take you closer to the beautiful destination</i>

Langtang Valley trek is considered to be one of the easiest treks for beginners. Through this trek, you can have different experiences in a single trek. You will be able to be so near to the giant Himalayas, you will be walking through deep forests, by the side of rapidly flowing Langtang river and its melancholic sound in the background, and many more. This trek can be called as an overall package to see real Nepal, with both adventure and ease within the trek.

<b>Detailed Itinerary</b>

<b>Day 1: Kathmandu - Syabrubesi</b>

The journey for the Langtang trek starts in Kathmandu. You can either book a jeep or take a local bus to reach syabru. 
Local Bus: You can take a public bus directly from Machapokhari, Balaju. The local bus leaves early in the morning around 7 to 9 am. The public buses can be a bit old and uncomfortable as the road condition is not quite good, so it would be a bumpy ride to syabru. The bus fare will be around 500-800 NPR.
Private Jeep: You can also travel via Jeep if you do not prefer a local bus. You will not find any tourist buses going to syabru. So, Jeep would be the only option that can be on the costlier side (10000-15000). There will be a total of 7-8 seats in a jeep, so if you have a group, then you can prefer the jeep ride.
Syabrubesi is about 50 miles north of Kathmandu valley. It will mostly take 8-9hr to reach syabru keeping the lunch breaks and traffic in the count. From a private jeep, you can reach a few hours early as compared to local buses.

After reaching syabru, you can freshen up and go sightseeing around Syabrubesi. There are very good hotels with 24 hr electricity and hot water. There will be no power outages or load shedding due to the Chilime Hydropower Plant. So, it is advised to charge all your electric equipment here, because there will not be electricity at the place where you will be staying the next day. 

<b>Day 2: Syabrubesi - Lama Hotel (8 hrs )</b>

From this day, the official trekking days begin. Get up early, have breakfast, and start your trek by 8 in the morning. In all the trekking days in this trek, one thing always is constant. You will have a huge Langtang river flowing by your side. This day you will be walking amidst the huge dense forest, hear the pleasant sounds of birds, come across beautiful waterfalls.

You can stop at Bamboo for lunch and stay at Lama Hotel. There are about 5-6 hotels/lodges at Lama Hotel, but there will not be electricity in this place.

<b>Day 3: Lama Hotel - GhodaTabela - Thangsyap - Langtang Village (8 hrs)</b>

It is always recommended to start your trek early because mornings are when you will feel most energetic. This day too, you will walk by the side of the river, into the forest, and from today, you will get a glimpse of the mighty Langtang Himal. After coming across a place called Riverside, you will see two paths to reach a place called GhodaTabela. There will be a bridge that leads to the dense forest and is a comparatively easier and longer route. For the second route, you have to walk uphill and is about 1 or 2 hours shorter than the previous one. But it is recommended to confirm with the locals at Riverside or Lama Hotel, as the second route might have been closed due to some landslide.

We stopped at a place called Thangsyap for our lunch that day. From Thangsyap, Langtang Village is just 2 hours away. We stayed at Langtang Village this day. [Since we visited at the time of Covid Pandemic, the hotels of GhodaTabela were closed, so we had to reach Thangsyap for lunch. Otherwise, the trekkers mostly stop at GhodaTabela for lunch.]

<i>[Note: If you can and have plenty of time, you can reach Kyanjin Gompa this day. Kyanjin Gompa is about 3-4hr from Langtang village and a beautiful place to stay and enjoy the scenic view]</i>

<b>Day 4: Langtang Village - Kyanjin Gompa (4hrs)</b>

For this day, you need to start your day as early as possible. You can start your trek by 6 in the morning and reach kyanjin Gompa by 10. After having some rest and enjoying lunch, you can climb Kyanjin Ri (about 2 hrs uphill) the same day. 

![Beautiful Kyanji Gompa]({{site.baseurl}}/images/langtang/day4_kyanjingompa.jpg)
*Beautiful Kyanjin Gompa*

Kyanjin Ri (4773m) is a small hill situated at the northeast of Kyanjin Gumba(3830m). It will take about 2 to 3 hrs to reach the top from which you can have a majestic view of Langtang valley, surrounding peaks, glaciers, and rivers. The earlier, you start for this trek, the best view you can get. Because after 12 in the afternoon, the clouds start to build up, covering all the beautiful mountains, and also the strong wind blows making it difficult to ascend. 

<i>[We started the trek at 8 in the morning and reached Kyanjin Gompa at 12. After having lunch and some rest, we left for Kyanjin Ri at 1:30 - 2 pm. We were quite lucky in terms of viewing the mountains there, but the ascend was quite difficult due to the heavy wind. So, it is highly recommended to start the trek for Kyanjin Ri as early as possible. This will have two perks: 

(1) You will get a pleasant view of the mountains from Kyanjin Ri

(2)You can get plenty of time to explore Kyanjin Gompa, as it is the most beautiful place to stay in Langtang trek. If possible, try to reach Kyanjin Gompa, on the 3rd day.]</i>

<b>Day 5: Kyanjin Gompa - Tsergo Ri (5 hr uphill - 3 hr downhill) - Kyanjin Gompa - Langtang Valley (2hr) - Optional</b>

Tsergo Ri is another peak in this trek, which starts from Kyanji Gompa. Situated at 5033m, it will take about 5hr uphill to reach the top of Tsergo Ri. You will get to see the magnificent 360-degree view of different mountains like Yala Peak, Langtang Ri, Langtang Lirung. At the top of Tsergo Ri, you will be surrounded by mountains in all directions, one of the breathtaking experiences for the trekkers. This trek can be taken as an optional trek as it will be one of the strenuous days. You have to carry some dry food, energy bars and water as there are no tea shops or hotels on the way. It will take a total of 8 hr for Tsergo Ri peak, so it is advised to start your day by 5 am in the morning, because after 12 pm the weather will be windy and the clouds will block the view.

Instead, you can go sightseeing around Kyanjin Gompa. There are 5 small lakes about 1hr away from Kyanjin Gompa. If you have gone to Kyanjin Ri, the previous day, you will be able to see the aerial view of those small lakes. 

After spending the day in Kyanjin Gompa, at around 3-4 in the evening, you can start your trek back to Langtang Valley and spend your night there.

<b>Day 6: Langtang Valley - Syabrubesi (8-9hr)</b>

This will be the last trekking day. So, start your trek early after having breakfast at the hotel. You can stop for lunch at Lama Hotel and reach syabrubesi in the evening.

<b>Day 7: Syabrubesi - Kathmandu</b>

You can either book a bus ticket (if available) or reserve a jeep and be back at Kathmandu completing 6 beautiful days within nature.

<i>(Note: We went for this trek in 2020 (28 Oct - 3rd Nov) in times of Corona Pandemic. So, we had started this trek only after getting our “negative” PCR Test Report.)</i>
